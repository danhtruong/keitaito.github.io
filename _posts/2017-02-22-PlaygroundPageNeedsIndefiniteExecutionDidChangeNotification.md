I watched [objc.io Swit Talk Episode 27, Typed Notification Part 1][1]. I just learned there is a notification for `PlaygroundPage.current.needsIndefiniteExecution` change. It is called [`"PlaygroundPageNeedsIndefiniteExecutionDidChangeNotification"`][2]. It's super long. I think I can't type it correctly without typo!!! This Swift Talk is about how to wrap these notifications to use them with type safety. Cool technique!
