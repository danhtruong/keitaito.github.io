When I restored my MacBook from Time Machine backup, Mac Reminders.app was not synced. I googled it.

[How do I force iOS Reminders to sync?](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/181078/how-do-i-force-ios-reminders-to-sync)

It seems Reminders.app sync is dependent on Calendar.app. Calendar.app was out of sync too. I fixed Calendar.app sync, then Reminders.app started syncing again.
