I'm writing this diary post because I want to keep GitHub commit streak ðŸ˜›

I went to Berkeley today. It's been a sooo while since I went there last time. Maybe more than one year?

I hung out with four of my friends. One was one of my old friends. The rest was new friends! One was from Japan, she went to CES with my old friend. Two were from Vallejo. We went to a crepe cafe downtown Berkeley first for brunch, then had a little walking in UC Berkeley, visiting Sather Tower. We went to Asha Tea place downtown Berkeley after that. I had a tasty boba tea. We split with two Vallejo friends, and went to see another friend living in Berkeley. He was another new friend of today. We had a chat about this year's CES, I didn't go there though, the future of self-driving car, education, coffee.

It was a long day, but I made many new friends. Fun day ðŸ˜ƒ
