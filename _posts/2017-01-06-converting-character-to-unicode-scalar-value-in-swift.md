You sometimes want Unicode scalar value (or Ascii code value) of a character. For example, unicode scalar value of "A" character is 65(You can check it out with [Ascii code table](http://www.ascii-code.com)).

```swift
// Unicode scalar value of "A" is 65.
let unicodeScalarValueOfA = 65
```

Hardcoding magic number is not cool, right? Let's get the value with Swift awesome APIs.  

Swift's String type has an instance property called `unicodeScalars`. This sounds good to use. However, the return value is of type `String.UnicodeScalarView`.

```swift
// Return type is String.UnicodeScalarView.
let convertedA = "A".unicodeScalars
```

`UnicodeScalarView` can be considered as "[a collection of Unicode scalar values.](https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/string.unicodescalarview)", as my understanding. UnicodeScalarView is kind of `[UnicodeScalar]`. And, `UnicodeScalar` type has `value` instance property, which represents unicode scalar value. To get the value, `map` function, which is my favorite awesome higher-order function, can be used here.

```swift
// $0 is of type UnicodeScalar.
let mappedA = convertedA.map { $0.value }
```

It's not done yet. What is the type of mappedA constant variable here? `value` property is of type `UInt32`. And, since convertedA, array of UnicodeScalar, is mapped, the return value is also an array. Thus, the type of mappedA is `[UInt32]`. It's an array that has one element.   Probably you usually want to use the unicode scalar value as integer, the array type is not preferred so much. Here, we can use another higher-order function `reduce`. An array can be combined to one element type. In this case, the `mappedA` array has only one element, it looks like `[65]`. Let's change it to `65`.

```swift
let reducedA = mappedA.reduce(0, +)
```

Thanks to the awesome Swift type inference, you can just pass in `+` operator to `reduce` function's closure parameter.

In conclusion, let's write all of the above in one line.

```swift
let AnotherUnicodeScalarValueOfA = "A".unicodeScalars.map { $0.value }.reduce(0, +)
```

Looks cool, huh? You might feel like "too many types!". But it also means the Swift compiler always gives us many hints to solve problems. Types are your friends ðŸ˜Ž
