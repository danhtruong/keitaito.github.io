I organized an [iOS Peer Lab Meetup][1] at Workshop cafe today (on Jan 29, 2017). Thanks Romy for joining it.

- Worked on researching CocoaPods issues.
- Tried CocoaPods Rainforest for development.
- Learned "[Using the files from a local path][2]", e.g., `pod 'AFNetworking', :path => '~/Documents/AFNetworking'`.
- Learned [pod install vs. pod update][3].
