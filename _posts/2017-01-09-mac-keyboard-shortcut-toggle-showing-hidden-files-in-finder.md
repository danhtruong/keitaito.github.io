Do you know the keyboard shortcut how to toggle showing hidden files in Finder?
I just learned it when I was browsing [Qiita](http://qiita.com/hmiura/items/4709e0776d14055fb2f8) earlier.

### Toggle showing hidden files in Finder

```
Cmd + Shift + . (period)
```

I usually prefer hiding hidden files, but I want to see them sometimes in Finder. This keyboard shortcut could be useful!
