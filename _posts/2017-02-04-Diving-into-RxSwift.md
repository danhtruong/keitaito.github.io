ðŸš§ This post is under construction ðŸš§

I got motivated to learn Functional Reactive Programming more by [Greg Heo][1]'s talk. So, I started to reading RxSwift repo's Getting Started guide. Also, I'm doing a RxSwift tutorial on [Ray Wenderlich][2].

### My Note

- RxSwift is the core framework.
- RxCocoa is the UI framework for Cocoa & Cocoa Touch.
